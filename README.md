## Report
Java programming language helps performing such automated task to facilitate user friendly application such as the one created in this report. Java was used to generate output in this project .
##Tools
Eclipse IDE for Java Developers The package includes : Eclipse java Development Tools , Maven Intergration for Eclipse,
•	Operation system : Windows 8.1
•	Computer Processor 64bit
I started by creating a folder called Assigment3 in Eclipse Works spaces . Then I created a new java project "TechnicalSupportEnginnerChallenge". And the also create a new class file called TechnicalSupportEnginnerChallengeTest".
## Unified Modeling Language (UML) Class Box of the proposed project.
 
 •	title: String
 
 •	uri: String
 
 •	author: String
 
 •	points: int
 
 •	comments: int
 
 •	ranks : int
 
 •	getTitle() : String
## Implementation Phase:
On Eclipse workspace, A class called “TechnicalSupportEnginnerChallenge” was created along with is fields such as title (String), uri(String), author (String), comments( int), points (int) and ranks(int) each with their corresponding data types to accept the value assigned to them .I created both custom and default contractors which are used to initialize instances for the TechnicalSupportEnginnerChallenge class. The get and set method was also used, where “get (accessor)” helps to return the value of private field created in the TechnicalSupportEnginnerChallenge program and “set(mutator) “helps to set the value of the private field. In the TechnicalSupportEnginnerChallenge class all the field used the toString() method to output a textual representation of the object current state. In the TechnicalSupportEnginnerChallenge Test class or where the main method coded. Array was used in storing the value of each of the TechnicalSupportEnginnerChallenge fields, making using of the data types assigned in the custom constructor created in the TechnicalSupportEnginnerChallenge class. The for loop on the other, used with the array goes into ever element to generate their values for end- user depending on the instructions written and accepted by the inputs.
.When a user enters any word all the output about the posts are generated .
